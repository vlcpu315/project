Database Structure(mySQL)

Can use the createDatabase.sql file to create database. May need to change credentials and location in the database.php file
for to connect to your database.

#	Name	        Type	        Collation	           Null	  Default	                Extra	Action
1	id           int(255)		                         No	    None		                AUTO_INCREMENT
2	email	       varchar(255)	  latin1_swedish_ci		 No	    None
3	referee	      varchar(255)	latin1_swedish_ci		 Yes	  NULL
4	time	        datetime(6)			                   No	    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)
5	ip          	varchar(255)	latin1_swedish_ci		 No	    None


1. To query api for information on a certain user:

    use URL GET request: localhost/project/api.php?query=*EMAIL HERE*
    or use POST: post into variable $_POST["query"]

2. To return all data as json

    use url GET request: localhost/project/api.php?all=*CAN PUT ANYTHING HERE AS LONG AS VARIABLE IS SET*
    use POST: post into variable $_POST["all"] //can be anything as long as variable is all

3. To delete a user

    use POST: post into variable $_POST["delete"] = *EMAIL YOU WANT TO DELETE*
    If testing in POSTMAN you need to select post via form data.

4. To Create a user

    use POST to send JSON data into api. Post into variable $_POST["create"]
    If testing in POSTMAN you need to select post via form data.

    JSON Format:
    [{
    "email":"as@as.com",
    "referee":"b@b.com",
    "ip":"123.125.236"
    }]

    or

    [{
    "email":"a@a.com",
    "ip":"123.125.236"
    }]


    Must have email and ip fields. If referee field is left blank it will just fill
    a null in the database. You can input multiple users at the same time.

    ex.

    [{
    "email":"a@a.com",
    "referee":"b@b.com",
    "ip":"123.125.236"
    },
    {
    "email":"a@a.com",
    "ip":"123.125.236"
    }]

5. To update user

    Use POST to send JSON data to api. Post into variable $_POST["update"]
    If testing in POSTMAN you need to select post via form data.

    JSON Format:
    [{
    "email":"d@d.com",
    "referee":"b@b.com"
    }]

    Can only update referee right now.
